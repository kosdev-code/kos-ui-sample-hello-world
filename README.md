## Start the app

To start the development server run `npm run serve`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!

## Build kab

There is a `kab` option as well that will run the build and produce a kab file that can be used during development as part of an image.

To run a kab of the entire application run `npm run kab`. This will create an optimized bundle in the `dist` folder at the root of the application.

The `kab` option is driven by a couple of environment variables that can be modified either in your environment or via a .env file at the root of the project:

**JAVA_CMD** - the path to the java executable

**KOS_INSTALL_PATH** - the kOS Studio installation directory. The `kabtool` will be found in this folder structure.

## Project Structure

The kOS UI project has been configured as an integrated NX mono-repo that incorporates projects for both UI applications and the corresponding kOS models required to integrate with a dispenser running kOS.

- apps
  - hello-world-ui - The UI application that is served to the browser
    - src
      - app
        - components - The UI components that make up the application
        - app.tsx - The main application component
- libs
    - hello-world-model - The model project that contains kOS models used by the application
      - src
        - lib
          - If you will generate model that comes under lib section by `kosui (root model, services, types)
            - root model - The dispenser model that acts as the root model for the application
            - services - The services that interact with the dispenser backend
            - types - The types that are used by the dispenser model


Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/core-features/distribute-task-execution)
